Each team member has a personal account. Sharing passwords/keys is forbidden.

No internet attacks: attacking external networks is prohibited. All tests must be confined to the lab network on the VM.

For any destructive tests (malware, exploits, full resets), file a Red Team Window request at least 24 hours in advance.

Before a Red Team Window: snapshots taken, backups confirmed, WAN access blocked for attacker.

After each session: push artifacts and notes to GitHub and add a short reflection (see template).

Violations may result in temporary suspension of access.
